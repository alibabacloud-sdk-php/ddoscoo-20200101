     * @description The back-to-origin policy. The value is a string that consists of a JSON struct. The JSON struct contains the following fields:
     *
     *   **ProxyMode**: The load balancing algorithm for back-to-origin traffic. This field is required and must be a string. Valid values:
     *
     *   **ip_hash**: the IP hash algorithm. This algorithm is used to redirect the requests from the same IP address to the same origin server.
     *   **rr**: the round-robin algorithm. This algorithm is used to redirect requests to origin servers in turn. If you use this algorithm, you can specify a weight for each server based on server performance.
     *   **least_time**: the least response time algorithm. This algorithm is used to minimize the latency when requests are forwarded from Anti-DDoS Pro or Anti-DDoS Premium instances to origin servers based on the intelligent DNS resolution feature.
     *
     *   **Attributes**: the parameters for back-to-origin. This field is optional and must be a JSON array. Each element in the array contains the following fields:
     *
     *   **RealServer**: the address of the origin server. This field is optional and must be a string.
     *
     *   **Attribute**: the parameter for back-to-origin. This field is optional and must be a JSON object. The value contains the following field:
     *
     *   **Weight**: the weight of the server. This field is optional and must be an integer. This field takes effect only when **ProxyMode** is set to **rr**. Valid values: **1** to **100**. Default value: **100**. An origin server with a higher weight receives more requests.
     *
     * @example {"ProxyMode":"rr","Attributes":[{"RealServer":"1.***.***.1","Attribute":{"Weight":100}},{"RealServer":"2.***.***.2","Attribute":{"Weight":100}}]}
